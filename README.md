### Why the Project is Useful ###
This application was the first time I really tried to play with CSS.

The app fulfilled a project assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. It provided me with the opportunity to work with the following technologies:
* Bootstrap
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
